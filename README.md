====================

This is the main repo for my site which is hosted on GitHub.
The site it built using [Jekyll](http://jekyll.com) which is a
static blog generator. I previously hosted the site on Tumblr
and so I've added a few plugins which I've found on various pages
around here. Of particular help is the [jekyll-tagging]() gem.
