michaelballphoto.com
====================

This is the main repo for my site which is hosted on GitHub.
The site it built using [Jekyll](http://jekyll.com) which is a
static blog generator. I previously hosted the site on Tumblr
and so I've added a few plugins which I've found on various pages
around here. Of particular help is the [jekyll-tagging](https://github.com/pattex/jekyll-tagging) gem. 
Because GitHub doesn't support jekyll plugins all my work is done in
the "Website" repo which hosts some other files for different sites.
The I copy the compiled site to the michaelballphoto.com repo and
push both to github. It's a little bit more work, but really only a
couple quick lines in shell script solve all the problems!
